# Algorithm-Concepts
NYIT_Summer-2022: Algorithm Concepts Assignments.
For running this file you only need Python 3.
## Tasks:
1.In the first question I wrote a class to implement Kruskal's minimum spanning tree for graphs (takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph) and test them with the sample data.
2.In the second question I wrote the rod cutting problem algorithm.
